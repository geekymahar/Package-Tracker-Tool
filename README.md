# Package-Tracker-Tool
An automated bash and PowerShell script for Linux and Windows operating systems. The script fetches package names and versions along with their installation times, and integrates with an SMTP mail server to transmit the final report to an email address in JSON format. This tool can be useful for enterprise infrastructure to keep track of applications.
